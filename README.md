## Live Demo

- If deployed, add the link here: `[Live Site URL]`
- Otherwise, open `index.html` directly in a browser or run a static server (see below).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gaurav2630/gorav-portfolio.git
cd gorav-portfolio
```

### Run locally

- Option 1: Open `index.html` directly in your browser
- Option 2: Use a simple static server

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 5500

# Node (serve)
npx serve -l 5500
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5500`.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main page markup, styles, and scripts
- `README.md` — You are here

If you later split assets, consider:

- `assets/css/` — Stylesheets
- `assets/js/` — Scripts
- `assets/img/` — Images and icons

## Customization

- Update personal details, links, and content directly in `index.html` sections (Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact)
- Replace social and email links with your own
- Adjust colors, spacing, and animations in the stylesheet (inline or external)

## Accessibility & Performance

- Semantic HTML with clear sectioning and landmarks
- Sufficient color contrast and focus states
- Optimized fonts and animations to minimize jank

Tips:

- Compress images before adding to `assets/img/`
- Use descriptive `alt` text for images
- Test on mobile and desktop viewports

## Deployment

This site is static and can be hosted on any static hosting provider:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Pages

Point the host to the repository (or built output if you later add tooling) and set the publish directory to the project root.
